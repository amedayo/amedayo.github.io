# How to Talk to Your Oshi in Online Event (22/7 Edition)

So you want to meet your oshi (fave) in an online event they're holding. Maybe spiral into talk/cheki (polaroid)/sign (autograph)-kai hell as well.
You have come to the right place! Look no further to this shitty guide. 

In this guide, we will cover three things:

1. [Signing up on FortuneMusic](#signing-up-for-fortunemusic)
2. [Getting tickets](#getting-tickets)
3. [Downloading and using the FortuneMeets app](#downloading-and-using-the-fortunemeets-app)   

**NOTE**: This guide will assume you have a _Tenso (proxy service) or a Japanese address_ you can use to have items shipped to you. If you don't, go apply for one first. 
Any specific questions on how to sign up can be answered at the #events chat at the [22/7 Discord](https://discord.gg/227) server.

also here's a handy glossary: 
* talk-kai (トーク会) = talk event, online event where you just say hi to the member you're meeting
* cheki-kai (チェキ会) = cheki (polaroid) event, a member will show you a random polaroid photo of themselves and you'll get that shipped to you.
* sign-kai (サイン会) = sign (autograph) event, you get an autograph from a member you're meeting. that'll be shipped to you.

ok let's get started :point_down: :sunglasses: :point_down:

   2. The name form below is the reading of your name in furigana so put your name in katakana. Use an [online keyboard](https://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/katakana.htm) if you have to. Or have someone transliterate it for you. **NOTE: family name (last name) goes first, given name goes last.**

## Getting Tickets
so now you wanna talk to your oshi. maybe get an autograph from them

before we start i wanna clarify a few things. 

1. Talk-kai and cheki/sign-kai are **different events**. You won't get an autograph if you attend a talk-kai event lmao.
2. There are different days/times when those go on.
3. The latter is more expensive. 
4. A complimentary CD of the single 22/7 may be promoting at the time is shipped to you with each ticket you buy. 

got it? got it.

1. Luckily, the FortuneMusic homepage should already feature 22/7 when you go there. Scroll down until you see a schedule of sorts.
2. You should see stuff when you scroll down. If you see a green button (受付中) then you can sign up there.   
![part2step2](https://i.imgur.com/B7YdcKL.png
4. On that next screen, you can see a list of members and the times and date they will be available. Most of you might be signing up to see Sally Amaki or something lol but for the people that don't understand a lick of Japanese (again, why are you here), here's a table of the member's names in kanji and a TL of it.
   1. If you live in a timezone that's vastly different than JST, google `[time] JST to [your own timezone]`. 

| Members | TL |
| --- | --- |
| 天城サリー | [Sally Amaki](https://nanabunnonijyuuni.fandom.com/wiki/Sally_Amaki)| 
| 海乃るり | [Ruri Umino](https://nanabunnonijyuuni.fandom.com/wiki/Ruri_Umino) |

5. Scroll down until you see green down arrows on grey blocks. You’ll see whichever slot that a member is available (scroll up for exact times.)  click on the dropdown boxes and choose an amount of tickets you want. If you’re done, scroll down and click green button (カートへ進む) 
![Part2Step5](https://i.imgur.com/3wb0alA.png)
6. So now you’re ready to pay. Click on the 6 boxes and click the right button on the bottom (unless you’re a elementary schooler)

7. Next screen is the confirmation screen. Click the green button.   
8. You're done now lol

## Downloading and using the FortuneMeets app

1. You might want to get used to the FortuneMeets app before the actual day of the online event. If you haven't already, download the [app](https://www.fortunemusic.app/).   
   NOTE: You might need to set your App/Play Store region to Japan to get the app. You'll only need to switch to a Japanese Apple ID on iOS. If you don't have a Japanese Apple ID, here's a [guide](https://www.wikihow.tech/Get-Japanese-Apps-on-iPhone-or-iPad) (I recommend following Method 2.) (i'm not familiar with android so you might need to figure out how to install JPN apps yourself)   
2. When you open the app, you should see a bunch of events for 22/7. Press the second button on the bottom to log in (your login should be the same you signed up FortuneMusic with.) ![part3step2](https://i.imgur.com/JIFUubi.jpg)
3. After you log in, you should see the events you have already paid for. If today's the day of the event, wait for the queue to open. (e.g. If you logged in at 10:15 JST, there's a 15 minute wait time before the actual event starts. You'll see the queue moving then.)
![part3step3](https://i.imgur.com/MeR6Iyr.png)
4. Wait in the queue. 
5. Congrats you have met your oshi. 

if you made it this far, it may be already too late. 

...and that's the end of the guide.

### Other Notes
* If you're not meeting Sally and don't have a clue on what to say to the member you're meeting, I recommend typing out a script and have it on a notepad on your computer. Keep in mind that one ticket in talk-kai is about 14 or so seconds (unless you bought multiple tickets and stacked them) so keep it brief. 
  * Stacking tickets is a whole another topic I won't bother to cover lol 
* If the online event is dedicated to 22/7's new single or something, then they will send out CDs to you since it's bundled with talk/cheki/sign-kai tickets. If you bought multiple tickets, then you may want to think of a way to get rid of extra CDs. Be aware that the CDs may also have low resale value at your local bookstore or something. ~~I recommend throwing the CDs into a river.~~

### Support or Contact

As this is meant to be in-general guide, not all questions will be answered here. Thus, any specific questions can be answered at the #events chat in the [22/7 Discord](https://discord.gg/227) server.
