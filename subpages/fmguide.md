# How to Talk to Your Oshi in Online Event (22/7 Edition)

So you want to meet your oshi (fave) in an online event they're holding. Maybe spiral into talk/cheki (polaroid)/sign (autograph)-kai hell as well.
You have come to the right place! Look no further to this shitty guide. 

In this guide, we will cover three things:

1. [Signing up on FortuneMusic](#signing-up-for-fortunemusic)
2. [Getting tickets](#getting-tickets)
3. [Downloading and using the FortuneMeets app](#downloading-and-using-the-fortunemeets-app)   

here's a handy glossary: 
* `talk-kai (トーク会)` = talk event, online event where you just say hi to the member you're meeting
* `cheki-kai (チェキ会)` = cheki (polaroid) event, a member will show you a random polaroid photo of themselves and you'll get that shipped to you.
* `sign-kai (サイン会)` = sign (autograph) event, you get an autograph on a postcard from a member you're meeting and that'll be shipped to you.

# READ THIS BEFORE YOU START SIGNING UP 

:exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation: :arrow_down: :arrow_down: :arrow_down: :exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation: 

* These online events are made for primarily Japanese people or those living in Japan, so by signing up FortuneMusic to meet your oshi, you understand the risks of not having much reliable support from customer service. 
* This guide will assume you have a _Tenso (proxy service) or a Japanese address_ you can use to have items shipped to you. If you don't, go [apply for one](https://www.tenso.com/en) first.   
* There are extremely rare cases (system bug or otherwise) of people encountering an ID check screen before entering the line in the FortuneMeets app. If that happens, please have this documentation with you:   
  * Your own passport   
  * That is literally it.   
  NOTE: You will absolutely only need to show your passport and _**only**_ that if you ever encounter the ID Check screen. Do not show any other form of identification such as your state ID card. However, you probably won't ever need to have it ready as the staff (22/7's staff specifically) won't ever ask for it.
* There are cases where an online event will hold same-day sales. Please be aware that problems may arise processing payments if you ever decide to participate in an event on the same day as applications open. 

Any specific questions on how to sign up can be answered at the #events chat at the [22/7 Discord](https://discord.gg/227) server.

ok let's get started :point_down: :sunglasses: :point_down:

2. Click the green button on the right (規約に同意して次に進む) when you go to the Terms and Conditions page.

* * *

## Getting Tickets
so now you wanna talk to your oshi. maybe get an autograph from them

before we start i wanna clarify a few things. 

1. Talk-kai and cheki/sign-kai are **different events**. You won't get an autograph if you attend a talk-kai event lmao.
2. There are different days/times when those go on.
3. The cheki/sign-kai are more expensive. 
4. A complimentary CD of the single 22/7 may be promoting at the time is shipped to you with each ticket you buy. 

got it? got it.

1. Luckily, the FortuneMusic homepage should already feature 22/7 when you go there. Scroll down until you see a schedule of sorts.
2. You should see stuff when you scroll down. If you see a green button (受付中) then you can sign up there.   
![part2step2](https://i.imgur.com/B7YdcKL.png)
4. On that next screen, you can see a list of members and the times and date they will be available (example image below). Most of you might be signing up to see Sally Amaki or something lol but for the people that don't understand a lick of Japanese, here's a table of the members' Japanese names and a TL of it.
   1. If you live in a timezone that's vastly different than JST, google `[time] JST to [your own timezone]`.

5. Scroll down until you see green down arrows on grey blocks. You'll see which slots each member is available for (scroll up for exact times).  click on the dropdown boxes and choose the number of tickets you want. When you’re done, scroll down and click the green button (カートへ進む) 
![Part2Step5](https://i.imgur.com/3wb0alA.png)
6. So now you’re ready to pay. Click on the 6 boxes and click the right button on the bottom (unless you’re an elementary school student)
![Part2Step6](https://i.imgur.com/yS3l1NA.png)
7. Next screen is the confirmation screen. Click the green button.   
8. k you're done on that part.

NOTE: If you're buying multiple tickets, then you will get results on which tickets you have gotten. This works as a lottery system-kinda thing (i'm bad at explaining this.) Basically if you go to your MyPage on FortuneMeets website and go to the first green button on the right (抽選申込履歴), you will see the results of the tickets you have won. You only pay the tickets you have won. If you only buy one ticket then you'll get that ticket guaranteed. 

* `当選` = Hit, you won every ticket   
* `一部当選` = You won some of the tickets   

NOTE2: As noted in the "Before You Apply" section, there may be cases where applications are open the same day of a talk-kai or so. There are risks to signing up for them, such as payments may not be processed before the actual timeslot you signed up for. Be warned. :ghost:
   * Normally, CDs will be bundled from FortuneMeets by default if you bought multiple orders. However, sales from now on (or maybe for just the 7th single) will have CD orders shipped individually and cost separate shipping charges past the single's release date, instead of being bundled together like before. CDs are still grouped per order. You can still use Tenso to consolidate your packages.

## Downloading and using the FortuneMeets app

For an in a nutshell-visual guide on how to use this, here's a [video guide](https://youtu.be/Qe7qJXWTpts) on how to use the app from some of the 22/7 members themselves.

1. You might want to get used to the FortuneMeets app before the actual day of the online event. If you haven't already, download the [app](https://www.fortunemusic.app/).   
   NOTE: You might need to set your App/Play Store region to Japan to get the app. You'll only need to switch to a Japanese Apple ID on iOS. If you don't have a Japanese Apple ID, here's a [guide](https://www.wikihow.tech/Get-Japanese-Apps-on-iPhone-or-iPad) (I recommend following Method 2.) (i'm not familiar with android so you might need to figure out how to install JPN apps yourself)   
2. When you open the app, you should see a bunch of events for 22/7. Press the second button on the bottom to log in (your login should be the same you signed up FortuneMusic with.) ![part3step2](https://i.imgur.com/JIFUubi.jpg)
3. After you log in, you should see the events you have already paid for. If today's the day of the event, wait for the queue to open. The queue opens on the first set of times. (受付時間)
![part3step3](https://i.imgur.com/MeR6Iyr.png)
4. If the queue opens, the button for the event will light up. Click on that. (You may want to restart the app if it doesn't.)
5. You will then see a list of members and it will also show if you have tickets for them. Click to enter queue.
6. You'll get a screen asking if you want instructions, or there's a skip (スキップ) link at the very bottom.
7. A popup asks how many tickets to use - enter a number an hit the green button (決定する) to confirm
8. You get a confirmation screen, hit OK.
9. The app will do a camera test so you see what they see, hit green button to continue.   
10. The next screen will have you to choose your screen name (big green button at bottom) Enter something and confirm on the next popup (please don't enter something innappropiate.)   
11. Wait in the queue. It will show the number of people in line ahead of you and the remaining time you have until you meet the member you're meeting. If you joined around the beginning of the time the queue opens, you have a 15 minute wait until the line actually starts moving which is when the event actually starts.   
11. Congrats you have met your oshi. :confetti_ball:   

if you made it this far, it may be already too late.   

...and that's the end of the guide.   

### Other Notes
* If you're not meeting Sally and don't have a clue on what to say to the member you're meeting, I recommend typing out a script and have it on a notepad on your computer. Keep in mind that one ticket in talk-kai is about 14 or so seconds (unless you bought multiple tickets and stacked them) so keep it brief. 
  * Stacking tickets is a whole other topic I won't bother to cover lol 
* If the online event is dedicated to 22/7's new single or something, then they will send out CDs to you since it's bundled with talk/cheki/sign-kai tickets. If you bought multiple tickets, then you may want to think of a way to get rid of extra CDs. Be aware that the CDs may also have low resale value at your local bookstore or something. ~~I recommend throwing the CDs into a river.~~
* You may experience major lag during calls. 
* FortuneMeets as an app sucks in general for many reasons. One thing about it is that there were many cases where events paid for won't show up at all for some people. While the suggestions from various users were to change language/system region to Japanese, the best case scenario is to restart or reinstall the app.   
* It's recommended that you wear earbuds for the talk.
* Lastly, _**DO NOT RECORD!**_ just don't do it bro, you'll be kicked.
