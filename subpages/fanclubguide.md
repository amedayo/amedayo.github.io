# How to Sign Up for 22/7 Fanclub

*all (translated) images are borrowed from Liu from the 22/7 server.

So you want to join the 22/7 fanclub. (the official one, not the [server](http://discord.gg/227))
You have come to the right place! Look no further to this guide. This will cover on how to sign up (and maybe what you can do in fanclub when I have more time to write)

We'll only cover on how to sign up Fanclub

## How to Sign Up

* **It's recommended that you're on your smartphone for this.** 
1. On the [official](https://nanabunnonijyuuni.com/) website, go to the 3 bars icon on the top left (bottom right on smartphone). A bunch of options will pop-up. We want to go to "Fanclub". Click on that. (or here's a direct [link](https://nanabunnonijyuuni-mobile.com/) to it.)
2. If you're viewing the site on PC, there's a QR code you can scan with your phone so go do that. ↓   
    → If you're on the site on your smartphone, it'll show two options: one to register and one to log in. Click the first (blue) one.

3. Enter your email. After that, click that checkbox. Then go to confirm your email. Don't use かんたんログイン unless you have a Japanese phone provider account.

4. Set your password. There are no special requirements.
5. Choose if you want to pay with your phone, credit card, or paying at a konbini. If you don't live in Japan, click the second option.
* PLEASE NOTE: You can use a debit card even though the option says "credit card". But make sure the card you're using has a security code on the back or else you won't be able to sign up.
